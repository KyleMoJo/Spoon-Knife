### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Has this successfully happened? It’s so hard to tell what the hell is going on.

After forking this repository, you can make any whatsoever changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
